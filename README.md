# linear_system
Simple python code written in order to solve linear system considering that it might be represented as a matrix equation Ax = b. So firstly the system's size has to be informed and then the user must enter with matrix's A coefficients and vector's b coefficients respectively. Sooner the program will output the result x as an array.

The code was developed by using python language and some of its packtes(libs).
